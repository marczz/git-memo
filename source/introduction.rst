This is a collection of notes related to git use. These notes have
been taken mainly for my own usage, to help me to understand some
feature or to remember the way of doing common operations.

There are many good tutorials, but this memo is not a tutorial.
Most of the key points you have to learn first
are skipped, some points are very easy and common, some are exploring
git use more in depth.

I am not a git expert, and I'm sure thet there are errors,
inaccuracies, and easier ways to accomplish the tasks. I will be happy
to learn them in your `pull requests <https://github.com/marczz/git-memo/pulls>`_!

But If ever you find here something useful for your daily use of git,
I am happy to share these notes with you.

Beside this memo I have also put pointers to git documentation
in the `Git section and subsections
<http://www.mzlinux.org/node/265>`_ of my `mzlinux site
<http://www.mzlinux.org/>`_.
